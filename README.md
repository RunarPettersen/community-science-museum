The Community Science Museum was our first semester project at Noroff.

## Description

We were given clear guidelines on how to complete the assignment. For example, we were not allowed to use JavaScriptâ€”only HTML and CSS. The design needed to be child-friendly but not overly childish. The task described a museum for older children, so I aimed for a design that could be fun for kids. I created Professor Kaos, a character I drew myself, and incorporated into various parts of the site.</p><p>I also designed the logo, which features a test tube cleverly used as both the 'I' and 'U' in the name.
